## This repository is for weekly problem sheets for the Programming and Scripting Module

# Week 02 - BMI calculator

In this task I wrote a program which asks the user to input their height and weight, converted the input to a float and output the user's BMI in 2 decimal places. I used the weekly lecture as reference and researched the BMI calculation. After the review, I added {:.2f} to round the output to two decimal places.

# Week 03 - Second string

This program takes an input string from the user and outputs every second letter in reverse.

# Week 04 - Collatz

This program asks the user to input a positive integer and outputs the successive values of these calculations;

At each step, calculate the next value by taking the current value, if it's even, divide by 2, if it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Using while loop, this program
runs until the number reaches 1. I added (end=' ') after the interim review to display output horizontally.

# Week 05 - Weekday

This program uses the weekday function and return a message stating whether today is a weekday/weekend. Using date.weekday(), digits 0-6 represent consecutive days of the week, starting from monday.

# Week 06 - Square root

This program gets the approximate square root of the users input, using Newton's method. I used this formula squareroot = 0.5 * (approx + (usersinput / x))  to get a broad estimate of the square root of the input number. Using a while loop to calculate a more accurate answer, to only stop the process when the better estimate equals to the initial assumed estimate.

# Week 07 - Count Es

This programs reads a text file and outputs the number of e's the file contains. I am assuming that only lower case e need to be counted, taking the sentence quite literally.
It took me a while to understand the task, but after looking through a few forums, I based the start of my code from the below stackoverflow answers. filename = sys.argv[-1]  takes the file name from an argument on the command line and used the lecture/lab/w3 notes to create a file moby-dick and open it in read mode.

# Week 08 - plotTask

This program plots 3 different mathematical functions in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes. Using
